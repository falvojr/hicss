  Abstract                 = {Educational game design environments enable end users to create computer games and are used as an engaging medium to teach programming to novice programmers. Although the cooperative dimension of end-user programming has been recognized and collaboration among novice programmers is advised, educational game design environments have remained solitary and desktop based, with only limited support for sharing-at most through a supplementary Website. Inspired by cooperation benefits of Web 2.0, we have developed AgentWeb, a fully Web-based game design environment that incorporates cooperation tools into the game design process. Coupled with the participative nature of Web 2.0 applications, AgentWeb enables a richer class of learning and collaboration in which the download-upload operations are unnecessary and users are given instant access to the design and implementation of other games. The sharing of design is an enabling ingredient for cooperative design. We present a preliminary evaluation of AgentWeb's usability. Â© 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

  Abstract                 = {The brewing crisis threatening computer science education is a well documented fact. To counter this and to increase enrolment and retention in computer science related degrees, it has been suggested to make programming "more fun" and to offer "multidisciplinary and cross-disciplinary programs" [Carter 2006]. The Computer Visualisation and Animation undergraduate degree at the National Centre for Computer Animation (Bournemouth University) is such a programme. Computer programming forms an integral part of the curriculum of this technical arts degree, and as educators we constantly face the challenge of having to encourage our students to engage with the subject. We intend to address this with our C-Sheep system, a reimagination of the "Karel the Robot" teaching tool [Pattis 1981], using modern 3D computer game graphics that today's students are familiar with. This provides a game-like setting for writing computer programs, using a task-specific set of instructions which allow users to take control of virtual entities acting within a micro world, effectively providing a graphical representation of the algorithms used. Whereas two decades ago, students would be intrigued by a 2D top-down representation of the micro world, the lack of the visual gimmickry found in modern computer games for representing the virtual world now makes it extremely difficult to maintain the interest of students from today's "Plug&Play generation". It is therefore especially important to aim for a 3D game-like representation which is "attractive and highly motivating to today's generation of media-conscious students" [Moskal et al. 2004]. Our system uses a modern, platform independent games engine, capable of presenting a visually rich virtual environment using a state of the art rendering engine of a type usually found in entertainment systems. Our aim is to entice students to spend more time programming, by providing them with an enjoyable experience. This paper provides a discussion of the 3D computer game technology employed in our system and presents examples of how this can be exploited to provide engaging exercises to create a rewarding learning experience for our students.},

  Abstract                 = {Robot programming often sparks students' interest in programming, but it is not easy for them to program both procedure and reactivity of robot movements that are essential requirements. In this study, we reviewed in detail a new programming language, State-Based Squeak. It allows novice students to implement both procedure and reactivity of robots easily. The effect of this new language on robot programming education was also examined using a group of 28 middle school students. According to the results of analyzing the students' understanding of programming, reading and programming abilities the group that used State-Based Squeak (the experimental group) showed a higher completion ratio than the other (control) group. The significance of this study is that a robot programming language has been developed that addresses the concepts of both procedure and reactivity in such a way that middle school students can more easily learn how to program robots, something that is often difficult to attempt even for professional programmers. &copy; 2012 KSII.},

  Abstract                 = {The importance of software testing is widely recognized, but usually only a small portion of the Computer Science (CS) curriculum is allocated for teaching it. Some experiences have suggested that the teaching of software testing should begin as early as possible so an adequate culture of testing could be created. One way to achieve this is addressing testing practices in conjunction with programming concepts in introductory CS courses. In this paper we explore such idea, working on the integration between the teaching of software testing along with the teaching of programming foundations. We discuss the development of an educational module, and its related learning materials, for integrating such knowledge domains. Besides that, we propose PROGTEST - a Webbased environment for the submission and automatic evaluation of practical programming assignments based on testing activities, aiming at providing an adequate feedback to evaluate the learners' performance concerning programming and testing. &copy; 2008 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {"The Multi-User Programming Pedagogy for Enhancing Traditional Study" (MUPPETS) system has been under development at RIT for the last three years. This multi-user environment is designed to allow students to develop visible 3D objects in Java within a game-world environment with minimal knowledge of graphics programming. Students can interact with these objects through an interface built into the system. (Technical aspects of the MUPPETS system were previously published by the authors at CITC4) [1]. In testing the usefulness of MUPPETS as a teaching tool, we have developed a series of course modules that use the environment as its programming environment. The existing "Programming for Information Technology III" course is the ideal place to perform an initial test of this nature, as students have some base familiarity with the Java language but have not yet completed their undergraduate programming core. Students in this course have a final group programming project that we intend to use as the initial test, and develop further MUPPETS modules downwards towards the initial freshman experience. In the past students used a package called "Robocode", which is available from IBM [2]. This project involved programming a virtual robot that could "fight" in an arena according to some agreed upon set of rules, which were developed both as part of the Robocode package and discussed and agreed upon in lecture While the students enjoyed this project, the proliferation of available code on the Internet for the framework led to this project being removed from the course. We have implemented a variant of "RoboCode" in MUPPETS that addresses the code availability issue and provides a more interesting and graphically rich environment for the students.This paper shall discuss the reasons for the implementation, what we expect the students will gain from the use of MUPPETS based project, and possible methods of comparing this approach to the methods previously used in this course. Also discussed are additions to the MUPPETS system made to facilitate its classroom use including a re-implementation of the Swing graphics classes such that 2D interfaces are available in 3D, and model loading and texturing tools that allow custom robot creation and customization.

  Abstract                 = {Programming foundations is not an easy subject to be taught - many students have difficulties understanding the abstract concepts of programming and have a wrong view about the programming activity. In order to address these problems, experiences have suggested the integrated teaching of programming concepts and software testing in introductory CS courses. Shortly, the idea is that testing can contribute to enhance the students' capabilities of understanding and analysis. However, such perspective requires tools to provide an adequate feedback to evaluate the students' performance concerning programming and testing activities. In this paper we describe ProgTest - a web-based tool for the submission and automatic evaluation of practical programming assignments based on testing activities. Results from a preliminary validation of ProgTest are also presented. Such results provide evidences on the practical use of ProgTest as a supporting mechanism for the integrated teaching of programming foundations and software testing. &copy; 2011 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {Existing research and practice in software development environments shows no clear consensus on the most appropriate development tools to use; these may range from simple text editors through teaching-oriented examples to full commercial integrated development environments (IDEs). This study addresses this gap by examining student perceptions of two development environments at opposite ends of the complexity spectrum. The results, gathered over several years using students at a range of experience levels, suggest that complex commercial IDEs are appropriate for programming education, even for entry-level students. Indeed, they offer a range of features that may improve the understanding and productivity of students. However, given the greater simplicity of simple text editors and potential for students to become overly dependent upon the support mechanisms provided by IDEs, teaching IDEs in combination with simple text editors appears to offer an ideal combination to maximize learning opportunities and student employability. &copy; 2011 EDSIG.},

  Abstract                 = {At the nexus of education and technology, blended learning is growing rapidly. Integrating face-to-face and online learning, blending can enhance learning and optimize seat time. This paper describes the use of the blended e-learning model in a course "Data Structures and Algorithms" given at the Afyon Kocatepe University, Turkey. This model is realized as a combination of a face-to-face environment and online learning, using the University's Learning Management System (LMS) named @KU-UZEM. The LMS consists of many applications in accordance with SCORM standards, such as, student records, user roles, courses, exams security applications, student affairs, counseling services, internal communication, director processes and evaluation. It provides whole software infrastructure by a virtual academic institution and is currently used in Afyon Kocatepe University. This paper describes both the technology for course design and programme redesign adopted a blended learning approach with both face-to-face and online learning aimed at enhancing the students' control over their own learning. According to the obtained results with the performed experimental evaluation, the realized blended learning model provided more effective and efficient educational experience rather than traditional, face-to-face learning. A survey conducted at the end of the course also showed that students were satisfied with the pedagogical approach, and their academic achievements were also better than expected. Particularly important is that the dropout rate was greatly diminished, which could be related to students' satisfaction with the support they received from the teacher and the system. &copy; 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper addresses how CodeSpells uses the metaphor of wizardry, along with an embodied API to engage students in learning to program in Java. Giving novice programmers a concrete representation of code has been encouraged and shown to help students understand the concepts with more ease. There have been many attempts to improve the novice learning experience by providing: a visual programming language, a hardware component or an application that is more approachable. The benefit of this research is that students are better able to understand how abstract code effects the environment. We build on this work through CodeSpells by immersing novices in the abstraction of code through embodiment to allow them to understand complex and abstract programming problems as if they were being affected by what they wrote. In this paper we present a new approach to novice programming environments, one that embodies the user and encourages a quick grasp of introductory concepts followed by a deep understanding through exploration.

  Abstract                 = {The Java programming education to students has been held in a lot of universities and professional schools due to the reliability, portability, and easy learning. To assist this education, our group has developed a Java programming learning system based on the test-driven development method. However, this Web system targets students who have studied Java to some extent. In this paper, we propose a fill-in-the-blank problem function for this system to assist the learning of the Java reserved words by novice Java learners. Our function consists of a teacher service process and a student service process. By the former one, a teacher can generate a fill-in-the-blank problem easily by blanking the specified reserved words randomly from a sample Java code in the database. By the latter one, a student can repeatedly submit answers of a problem until all the questions are correctly solved for self-study. The function is implemented on an existing Web system and is applied to students who are currently learning Java. The questionnaire result confirms the effectiveness of our proposal.},

  Abstract                 = {Computer Programming learning is a difficult process. Experience has demonstrated that many students find difficult to use programming languages to write programs to solve problems. Student failure and commonly expressed difficulties in programming disciplines suggest that traditional teaching approaches and study methods are not the most suitable for many students. There are several reasons that cause this learning problem, such as the lack of problem solving abilities that many students show. They don't know how to create algorithms, mainly because they don't know how to solve common problems. In this paper we describe several educational computer tools used successfully to support programming learning and we present a proposal for another computational system that may help reducing current problems. &copy; 2007 ACM.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper analyzes the educational effects of a peer-learning agent based on pair programming in programming courses. A peer-learning agent system was developed to facilitate the learning of a programming language through the use of pair programming strategies. This system is based on the role of a peer-learning agent from pedagogical and technical aspects and simulates the tutor and tutee. The peer-learning agent uses artificial intelligence methods with a Bayesian network as well as teaching and learning methods that simulate pair programming. This paper develops a model for determining students' programming abilities. In addition, the roles of the tutor and tutee are like the roles of a navigator and driver in pair programming. The developed agent system is demonstrated to have positive effects on knowledge retention and transfer in a programming course, with a greater influence on transfer than on retention. This model combining peer-learning agents with a teaching and learning strategy is more effective in helping learners to acquire programming skills. &copy; 2009 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {Learning to program is not an easy task. Program comprehension is integral to this process. Two main theories of program comprehension have been identified as a result of more than thirty years of investigation into the human psychology of computer programming. Both theories rely on the presence of program beacons. Beacons are described as key features in a program that serve as indicators of a particular programming structure. Beacons primarily convey semantic knowledge about the program and tend to be highly recognizable within a program by expert programmers. Technology can assist novice programmers with the learning process associated with program comprehension by making use of interactive tools that focus on the identification of program beacons. This paper describes a program beacon recognition tool developed during 2005. The primary purpose of the tool is to encourage a novice programmer to correctly identify beacons within provided program extracts. The tool is an attempt to empower novice programmers while learning to program so that they master the skills directly associated with progam comprehension. &copy; 2006 IEEE.},

However, what if the ultimate learning goal of the novice is to be able to program in conventional textual languages, as is the case for introductory computer science students? Can direct manipulation programming environments lower the initial barriers to programming, and, at the same time, facilitate positive transfer to textual programming? To address this question, we designed a new direct manipulation programming interface for novices, and conducted an experimental study to compare the programming processes and outcomes promoted by the direct manipulation interface against those promoted by a textual programming interface. We found that the direct manipulation interface promoted significantly better initial programming outcomes, positive transfer to the textual interface, and significant differences in programming processes. Our results show that direct manipulation interfaces can provide novices with a "way in" to traditional textual programming. &copy; 2009 ACM.},

Emphasis is given on the technology-enhanced educational tools that were selected or developed by the two institutions for teaching OOP. Different traditions and independent development at both institutions allow us to draw generally applicable conclusions and recommendations.},

  Abstract                 = {We studied the course-long use of a program visualization tool called ViLLE in high school in Finland. The study was conducted in three consecutive instances of the first programming course. In the first two instances of the course, the students did not utilize ViLLE - except for a short session - while in the last instance students did ViLLE exercises throughout the whole course. The students who used ViLLE got significantly better results from the course's final exam. This supports our hypothesis that program visualization can be an effective method in teaching programming, and indicates that we should continue developing program visualization methods to further enhance learning. &copy; 2010, Australian Computer Society, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe Storytelling Alice, a programming environment that introduces middle school girls to computer programming as a means to the end of creating 3D animated stories. Storytelling Alice supports story creation by providing 1) a set of high-level animations, that support the use of social characters who can interact with one another, 2) a collection of 3D characters and scenery designed to spark story ideas, and 3) a tutorial that introduces users to writing Alice programs using story-based examples. In a study comparing girls' experiences learning to program using Storytelling Alice and a version of Alice without storytelling support (Generic Alice), we found that users of Storytelling Alice and Generic Alice were equally successful at learning basic programming constructs. Participants found Storytelling Alice and Generic Alice equally easy to use and entertaining. Users of Storytelling Alice were more motivated to program; they spent 42% more time programming, were more than 3 times as likely to sneak extra time to work on their programs, and expressed stronger interest in future use of Alice than users of Generic Alice.

It is important to educate novice programmers in order to increase the population of programmers. They have to read source codes of various programs, when they learn programming. But, it is not easy task for them to understand the behavior of a program only by reading the source code. This paper describes implementation and evaluation of an automatic visualization tool "PGT(Path Generation Tool)" for aiding programs in reading the source code of a Java program. PGT generates paths from a source code by visualizing the paths corresponded to the statements of the source code so that understand the meaningof the program easily. &copy; 2007 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {Computer science eurriculums, constantly evolving to include new material and methodologies, have reduced the amount of time spent on low-level computer hardware and organization. Our institution recently combined a course on computer organization and a course on assembly language programming into one course covering both topics. The choice of assembly language is a critical decision that contributes to the success of the course. ANNA (A New Noneomplex Architecture) is a new 16-bit instruction set architecture that is similar to MIPS but has fewer instructions. The instruction set, while small, is sufficient in illustrating how high-level languages are translated into assembly, how to design a CPU datapath, and how to implement pipelining. Real-world assembly languages such as or MIPS have many subtleties that complicate the learning experience for students and consume valuable class time. This paper describes the ANNA assembly language and the assembler and simulator tools that can be used in the classroom. In addition, the paper describes how ANNA can be used effectively in a combined course on assembly language programming and computer organization. ANNA was used in three courses with very positive results based on our observations and feedback from students. Â© 2008 IEEE.},

MDAT automatically generates random schedules to allow students to more thoroughly test their programs. The design of MDAT takes full control over the scheduling allowing a failing run to be reproduced. To assist debugging, MDAT includes an output trace that shows the status of all threads, locks, and semaphores in the program and has an interactive mode that allows students to try out their own schedules. MDAT was effective at detecting deadlock and mutual exclusion violations in student submissions of the unisex restroom problem. . Copyright &copy; 2013 ACM.},

There are three distinguishing features of this course. First, it had a large number of students; almost 500 students were enrolled in it and most of them had minimal to no exposure to programming before taking the course. Second, it is taught at a Sino-British university but located in China - that is, the lessons were given in English and the curriculum met both the UK and Chinese standards. Third, the students had varied interests, ranging from engineering to computer science to industrial design. The experiences described in this paper will be useful to educators who are planning to integrate LEGO MindStorms into their teaching of programming to novice students who are from different backgrounds and with varied interests, enrolled in a large class, and who attend a university outside of developed countries. &copy; 2013 IEEE.},

On-line judges are widely used in everyday teaching, and their use in the scope of programming contests is currently especially well known. There are good tools and collections of programming problems available for exams as well as for contests. We have developed a simple, light, and practical open laboratory. The term open is used here in two senses: It is free for students to use and free to download and distribute under the GPL license. This laboratory hosts programming problems, it allows the instructor to easily add new ones, and it also automatically assesses the solutions sent by the students. In addition to the system, we have developed a collection of programming problems for CS1/2, designed from a pedagogical point of view and covering several levels of difficulty. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

  Abstract                 = {During their time at school few high school students are exposed to basic computing concepts as Computer Science (CS) is not considered to be an important part of the curriculum. As a result many high school students do not encounter programming during their studies. In the UK, despite newly qualified CS and ICT (Information and Communication Technology) teachers having specific subject knowledge, in recent years schools have steadily 'watered down' the content of CS courses and have aligned the subject with disciplines such as Business Studies. This has distanced Computing from the other sciences whilst adding to students' confusion about what the subject actually entails. This paper presents the results of a study which involved 23 trainee CS/ICT teachers. The study took the form of a day-long workshop session and had the objectives of determining what perceptions and opinions the trainee teachers held in regards to programming as well as to discover the effectiveness and potential of a programming teaching tool based on the concept of a robot simulator. Analysis of data collected during the session shows how, despite the majority of trainees having some programming experience, a number of trainees had difficulty completing basic programming challenges. This displays how some CS/ICT teachers may lack fundamental programming knowledge. Moreover, whilst most of the trainees felt programming should be taught to high school students studying a CS or ICT course, fewer than half of the trainees said they had the confidence to teach the subject. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the robot simulator as a teaching tool is also presented as is a discussion on the implications which these findings may have. &copy; 2011 ACM.},

  Abstract                 = {Good error messages are critical for novice programmers. Recognizing this, the DrRacket programming environment provides a series of pedagogically-inspired language subsets with error messages customized to each subset. We apply human-factors research methods to explore the effectiveness of these messages. Unlike existing work in this area, we study messages at a finegrained level by analyzing the edits students make in response to various classes of errors. We present a rubric (which is not language specific) to evaluate student responses, apply it to a course-worth of student lab work, and describe what we have learned about using the rubric effectively. We also discuss some concrete observations on the effectiveness of these messages.},

  Abstract                 = {C language is a major computer programming language, being widely used in software system development and education of computer science. However, comparing with other computer languages, C language is difficult and little uninteresting to its beginners and therefore, it takes more time to learn or teach. To give those beginners a interesting and comprehensible way to learn C language, we proposed a technique to make C language program visible. By this technique, the change of program status such as variable value in each step can be displayed in a graphical way. The effectiveness of this proposal was confirmed by experiments. &copy;2009 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {We have developed a tool that enables learners to observe the process by which they program through visualization of data that are recorded in the source code editor. One purpose of the tool is to assist learners by using the Personal Software Process (PSP) to allow them to analyze the process by which they program by using the tool after completing a programming task The proposed tool has functions for A) replaying a process using animation; B) automatic calculation of metrics; C) support for inputting subtasks; and D) process analysis report generation An evaluation experiment was conducted with participants from the second-level introductory programming course at our university The results were that 1) the accuracy of effort estimation dropped, although we clearly found that the reason for the drop was the difficulty of the second assignment; 2) according to a questionnaire, students reported both the effectiveness of the observation task and the effectiveness of the tool; and 3) there was large differences between students in terms of the description level of subtasks.

  Abstract                 = {In recent years, so-called serious games, where some kind of knowledge is gained through digital game play, have received significant attention and there has been an active movement toward games that effectively enrich the learning environment. Serious games are games that are developed according to the concept, “It is possible through game play to obtain some kind of knowledge while having fun. Through these serious games, there has been an active movement toward fun learning using games in education at school and internal training at organizations. In contrast, at universities the level of learning programming differs significantly depending on the academic background of the student and there are issues with traditional programming education learning because the student does not feel enjoyment and is not interested in information engineering. As a countermeasure, teaching methods and teaching aids etc. have been cited as themes and learning through the utilization of serious games and game development has been proposed to tackle these themes. In this paper we propose and evaluate serious games for programming learning based on the concept “Learning programming through gaming”.},

This system has two functions. The first is a program animation function which keeps a historical record of the students ' operations, and analyses this record to provide the information about difficulty of program actions to lecturers. The second is a compile-error support function which keeps a historical record of the students' errors, and then analyses this record and informs the lecturer about the correspondence between compile-error causes and particular lines of source code. This system should provide lecturers with full support and real-time solutions to common problems faced by students. &copy; 2006 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {AbstractContext Service-Orientation (SO) is a rapidly emerging paradigm for the design and development of adaptive and dynamic software systems. Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) has also gained attention as a promising and successful software reuse development paradigm over the last decade and proven to provide effective solutions to deal with managing the growing complexity of software systems. Objective This study aims at characterizing and identifying the existing research on employing and leveraging \{SO\} and SPLE. Method We conducted a systematic mapping study to identify and analyze related literature. We identified 81 primary studies, dated from 2000â2011 and classified them with respect to research focus, types of research and contribution. Result The mapping synthesizes the available evidence about combining the synergy points and integration of \{SO\} and SPLE. The analysis shows that the majority of studies focus on service variability modeling and adaptive systems by employing \{SPLE\} principles and approaches. In particular, \{SPLE\} approaches, especially feature-oriented approaches for variability modeling, have been applied to the design and development of service-oriented systems. While \{SO\} is employed in software product line contexts for the realization of product lines to reconcile the flexibility, scalability and dynamism in product derivations thereby creating dynamic software product lines. Conclusion Our study summarizes and characterizes the \{SO\} and \{SPLE\} topics researchers have investigated over the past decade and identifies promising research directions as due to the synergy generated by integrating methods and techniques from these two areas. },

  Abstract                 = {Fundamental concepts of programming and data structures are usually taught with graphical tools such as simulations and animations. Conflictive animations have been proposed to improve students' understanding of programming concepts. In conflictive animations, errors are introduced in the animations to motivate students to constantly check their knowledge against what is being animated. We have implemented a framework in an animation tool that allows the automatic generation of conflictive animations of statements, expressions, and other programming constructs. The automatic generation is challenging due to the alternative paths execution can take and their side effects. The architecture of the tool consists of several layers that can alter the normal interpretation or visualization of the program. The framework and the tool have been evaluated by creating conflictive animations of two programming concepts-for-loops and inheritance-and by running a set of 27 examples taken from Java textbooks. Of these, over two thirds (19) required no modification or only minor changes to create the conflictive animations. The reasons that the remaining examples did not generate conflictive animations automatically were divided between the layered architecture used and the example program itself. &copy; 2008 IEEE.},

The pedagogical model used in this study employs a combination of instructional strategies including directive support, responsive cognitive apprenticeship, collaborative learning, stimulating metacognition, using technologies via the use of tele-apprenticeship and online discussion. In an earlier study, students who participated within the CABLE project scored more highly on test scores, relative to comparable students who did not participate within CABLE, but these effects were found to be restricted to high-ability students. In the present study, students who participated within CABLE scored more highly than those participating within the non-CABLE group. However, with an enhanced CABLE environment, the benefits of CABLE were now evident in both ability groups, with the effects being more prominent within the low-ability group.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a QA cycle execution system for programming education matched to the learner's skill. The proposed system has the following features. (1) The language describing the QA cycle (EDML: Exercise Design Markup Language) is created. EDML is a language with the following functions. Various questions with the same difficulty and different content can be automatically generated. The answer evaluation environment and the selection of questions matched to the skill are described in a unified text for iterative learning matched to the learner's skill. (2) A method is established in which a learning system can easily be constructed by using an existing mail system. With the proposed approach, a remote learning system can be created without implementing functions for network security, generation of temporary logs, or program buffering in case of overload, which are essential elements of a remote learning system. This paper also describes the construction of a prototype of the proposed system. The proposed system was applied to a Pascal programming course for college freshman, and the results are described herein. &copy; 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {A substantial programming support tool that integrates a physical object such as a robot and educational programming language is one of useful instruments to foster not only general problem-solving skills but creative thinking. That provides an actual opportunity for learners to simulate the problem-solving process designed by themselves by utilizing the physical object to modify any incorrect prior knowledge or stereotype of problem-solving process that they may have. Such an experience is especially effective at stirring up creative thinking that refers to steadily exploring new solutions and seeking after a positive change of the given environ- ments. The purpose of this study was to develop a robot-aided programming program of instruction, and robot programming education by the program turned out to exercise a significant influence on the creative problem-solving skills of the learners who received that education. Specifically, that had a good effect on their divergent thinking faculty, critical/logical thinking faculty and motivational elements, which were subfactors of creative problem-solving skills. Therefore the robot programming education could be said to be one of good ways to improve the creative problem-solving skills of learners.},

Its educational effectiveness is expected to be shown after school students get involved in formal programming lessons using LOGO or other languages. It is emphasized that students need an introductory level for programming based on their intuitive knowledge before getting involved with algorithmic concepts using formal programming tools. This paper outlines an approach for: A) Using a subset of LOGO language in a 3D environment, B) Propose an alternative method for pre-programming education and C) Design a Serious Games application to address all of the above. Usability evaluation results are discussed in later sections. While the enduser evaluation is still in progress, the Expert Review Method was used for initial evaluation based on a set of heuristics for game usability, game play and educational effectiveness.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose - This paper proposes solutions to problems related to the maintenance and update of already existing e-learning courseware. Design/methodology/approach - A structured approach in form of a reference model for the re-engineering of existing educational material is presented. In this context, concepts already established in the area of aspect-oriented programming are applied to deal with crosscutting concerns in e-learning material. Finally, a software product line approach is proposed for the creation of new courseware using re-engineered components. Findings - It turns out that some aspects of the methodology developed for aspect-oriented programming can also be used to restructure the existing e-learning material in such a way that maintenance is eased and redundancy is significantly reduced. In addition, software product lines for e-learning material provide a global framework for coordinating the re-engineering and reuse of components. Practical implications - The advantage of the proposed approach is that existing e-learning standards and systems do not have to be modified or adapted. Originality/value - Usually, courseware evolves during a longer period of time and its development does not start every time from zero. There is a high incentive for re-engineering of existing courseware, since it constitutes in many cases the competitive advantage of companies or universities. However, up to now, little attention is paid to the maintenance and the efficient update of e-learning material which is already there. Â© Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

  Abstract                 = {Conceptual weaknesses have been identified in previous research that contribute to student learning difficulties related to computer programming. We postulate that improved learning can be achieved by using a tool that combines approaches from active learning and visualisation. We describe the architecture and features of a tool that supports mobile phone input to an interactive code execution framework which interfaces with Jeliot 3. Mobile users are able to contribute code snippets, and make predictions about execution behaviour of code executing in the tool. Individual feedback is provided to mobile devices in real time, allowing us to provide customised feedback to individual learners during a period of instruction. &copy; 2011 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {Java Programming Laboratory (JPL) is a cloud based, integrated learning environment used for teaching introductory Java programming at Griffith University, Australia. JPL incorporates a number of features found in other successful programming learning environments and builds upon them with a range of innovative features. Learning to program is a threshold concept area for ICT students and success in this endeavour is paramount for student progression and retention. JPL provides a database that tracks individual students' successes and progression through scaffolded programming exercises and assessment items and gives students immediate feedback on their use of programming language syntax and correctness of problem solutions. A data querying and visualisation facility allows analysis of the database to provide real-time performance indicators from the overall course / problem level down to the individual student / specific problem level. Programming instructors and curriculum designers will find that this facility allows a responsive approach to student engagement, assistance and progression; as well as course problem tuning in a just-in-time manner. &copy; 2013 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {The field of computational textiles has shown promise as a domain for diversifying computer science culture by drawing a population with broad and non-traditional interests and backgrounds into creating technology. In this paper, we present a curriculum that teaches computer science and computer programming through a series of activities that involve building and programming computational textiles. We also describe two new technological tools, Modkit and the LilyPad ProtoSnap board, that support implementation of the curriculum. In 2011-12, we conducted three workshops to evaluate the impact of our curriculum and tools on students' technological self-efficacy. We conclude that our curriculum both draws a diverse population, and increases students' comfort with, enjoyment of, and interest in working with electronics and programming. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

  Abstract                 = {In this article we present a new approach to teaching computer science - the evaluation and visual modeling of algorithms based on metaphorical forms - applied within the core of a virtual education system, the development module for computer-based lessons (LDS). We reveal the structure and characteristics of the teaching process that we implemented in the proposed system, students and their roles, applied teaching methods, solutions for evaluation and a case study on a lesson model. We presented the state of the art in this domain highlighting the advantages of the described solution set, and also possible extensions. Â© 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

  Abstract                 = {Many students feel difficulties in programming learning and, consequently, the failure rates in introductory programming courses are frequently high. Some students do not have the necessary commitment, while others do not show a natural ability for programming, which means they need more time to master the necessary knowledge and develop appropriate problem solving skills. Often, class pace is very intensive and many students are simply not able to follow all contents and activities. In order to help students with their studies it would be helpful if they could review classes so that they could clear doubts or take additional notes. Students that miss class for some reason could also take advantage of such possibility. In this paper we present a new system that we developed to record and replay lessons. The system is able to record the voice of the teacher, but also the main visual points of a class: the computer in focus in the class, the blackboard and the classroom environment. This system gives students the opportunity to review any part of a particular class, clear doubts that may have remained, review examples or exercises that may contribute to their programming learning. &copy; 2011 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents results from a video-based analysis of non-programmers' use of a new platform for end-user programming, the 3D Avatar Programming System (3DAPS). We use micro-ethnographic analytic methods to understand how learning about programming occurs. We discuss how the management of internal and external cognitive representations of 3D movement information leverages existing, embodied knowledge to unravel less familiar knowledge-that of programmatic instruction. In other words, the 3D movement serves as the language of translation between the representations to support learning. We also examine how shared code is used as an educational resource in a learning environment without a teacher. Copyright &copy; 2011 ACM.},

  Abstract                 = {From paper to computers, the way that we have been writing down thoughts and performing symbolic computations has been constantly evolving. Teaching methods closely follow this trend, leveraging existing technology to make teaching more effective and preparing students for their later careers with the available technology. Right now, in 2012, we are in the middle of another technology shift: instead of using PCs and laptops, mobile devices are becoming more prevalent for most everyday computing tasks. In fact, never before in human history were incredibly powerful and versatile computing devices such as smartphones available and adopted so broadly. We propose that computer programming, and thus the teaching of programming, can and should be done directly on the mobile devices themselves, without the need for a separate PC or laptop to write code. Programming on smartphones that we carry around with us at all times means instant gratification for students, as they can show their games and applications to their friends, and it means that students can do their homework or additional practicing at all times. We describe TouchDevelop, a novel mobile programming environment, and call out challenges that need to be overcome and opportunities that it creates. &copy; 2012 ACM.},

  Abstract                 = {MOOCs (massive open online courses) became a hugely popular topic in both academic and non-academic discussions in 2012. Many of the offered MOOCs are somewhat "watered-down versions" of the actual courses given by the MOOC professors at their home universities. At the University of Helsinki, Department of Computer Science, our MOOC on introductory programming is exactly the same course as our first programming course on campus. Our MOOC uses the Extreme Apprenticeship (XA) model for programming education, thus ensuring that students are proceeding step-by-step in the desired direction. As an additional twist, we have used our MOOC as an entrance exam to studies in University of Helsinki. In this paper, we compare the student achievement after one year of studies between two cohorts: the MOOC intake (n=38) and the intake that started their studies during the fall (n=68). The results indicate that student achievement is at least as good on the MOOC intake when compared to the normal intake. An additional benefit is that the students admitted via MOOC are less likely to drop out from their studies during their first year. &copy; 2013 ACM.},

The most successful courses have reached tens of thousands of participants. In our MOOC on introductory programming, we aimed to improve distinctive challenges that concern most of the open online courses: allowing and requiring the participants to be more active in their online learning ("flipped-classroom"), demanding them to go deeper than typical CS1 course, and added incentives for participant retention by treating the course as a formal entrance exam to CS/IT degree. Our Extreme Apprenticeship (XA) method for programming education appeared to be successful in an online environment as well. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

Professional program development environments are developed specifically for professional programmers and are often utilised by educational institutions to teach novice programmers. Pedagogical program development environments have been created to assist novice programmers in the process of learning to program. An empirical experiment was conducted to compare a representative professional program development environment with a representative pedagogical program development environment to determine how novice programmers are affected by the program development environment utilised. It was found that low risk novice programmers benefited significantly in terms of academic performance, while high risk novice programmers benefited significantly in terms of programming behaviour by using a pedagogical program development environment. The results indicate that a significant improvement in programming behaviour does not imply a significant increase in academic performance as well. Copyright &copy; 2008 ACM.},

  Abstract                 = {Learning to program is a difficult process for novice programmers. AutoLEP, an automated learning and assessment system, was developed by us, to aid novice programmers to obtain programming skills. AutoLEP is ability-training-oriented. It adopts a novel assessment mechanism, which combines static analysis with dynamic testing to analyze student programs. It not only helps students to sufficiently test the programs, but also evaluates whether the programs meet the specification or not. AutoLEP encourages students to find and work through bugs, by providing automatic syntactic and structural checking, and immediate detailed feedback. This can improve students' learning experience in programming and reduce the workload of the teaching staff. AutoLEP has been used in the C programming course at Harbin Institute of Technology and many other universities since 2004. The feedback on AutoLEP and its incorporation into the introductory programming course has been positive, both by students and teaching staff. &copy; 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

But standard compiler feedback is designed for experts - not novice programming students, who can find it difficult to interpret and understand. In this paper we present BlueFix, an online tool currently integrated into the BlueJ IDE which is designed to assist programming students with error diagnosis and repair. Unlike existing approaches, BlueFix proposes a feedback algorithm based upon frameworks combined from the HCI and Pedagogical domains, which can provide different students with dynamic levels of support based upon their compilation behaviour. An evaluation revealed that students' viewed our tool positively and that our methodology could identify appropriate fixes for uncompilable source code with a significantly higher rate of speed and precision over related techniques in the literature. &copy; 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Initially, we developed a framework that allows the students to run tests that are developed by the faculty member. That experience led us to developing a JUnit plug-in that allowed the students to specify the tests without having to write the test code. As a result of these experiences, we have re-structured this class into these roughly sequential phases: learning to read code, learning to write code, and learning to program. Throughout this course, the students are using TDD, writing their own JUnit tests, and refactoring as they develop their code iteratively. This change has been made without dropping any of the required course content. &copy; 2007 IEEE.},

Ensuring students are engaged in such assignments is critical in attracting and retaining students. To this end, WebHat, a service-based program evaluation platform, is introduced in this work to support programming assignment practice. WebHat provides students with immediate assistance via online evaluation services and helps teaching staffmonitor student status and progress. Based on the results of this system, teaching staffcan dynamically adjust, if necessary, online evaluation services to provide further help to enhance student engagement in the ongoing assignment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of WebHat, an empirical study is conducted with freshman students as the subjects during the Introduction to Computer Science course. The results show that students are encouraged to start working on their assignments earlier and develop programs in the desired direction with the aid of the dynamically adjusted online evaluation services. WebHat thus enables students to submit better final products with regard to both functionality and quality. International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS).},

  Abstract                 = {This article is chiefly concerned with multilingual programming language and system for collaboration of programming education in K-12. For a programming language to become a multilingual, it could be programmed in a manner independent on any locale. And this locale independent resource files can be easily translated into a new locale. Therefore when a multilingual programming language for K-12 is designed, it should have no keywords that have a particular meaning to the programming language. In addition, it specifies a set of characters which are based on Unicode character instead of a single character. Dolittle as a both multilingual and educational programming language has all kinds of features described above. Especially, it supports translation server for interculture collaboration between Korea and Japan to teach and learn programming education in K-12. We also conducted experimental lesson to evaluate the effectiveness of Dolittle's inflected dictionary in Korea. It was found from the result of the experimental lesson that using inflected dictionary of identifiers can decrease overall error ratio in comparison with using only one identifier.},

  Abstract                 = {The electronic white board and the tablet PC are bringing new technologies to modern education. This paper presents a pen-based flowchart recognition system for programming teaching, which uses hybrid SVM-HMM algorithm for sketch recognition. In this algorithm, ICA is used to reduce the dimension of features, a set of fuzzy SVMs are used as preliminary feature classifiers to produce fix length feature vector, which acts as a probability evaluator in the hidden states of Hidden Markov Models, and HMMs are employed as finally classifiers to recognize the unknown pattern. Experiment results show the hybrid algorithm has good learning and recognition ability. And based on this algorithm, an intelligent whiteboard system for programming teaching is designed to identify the sketches into the programming flowchart, and finally converts it into C language programs. User's evaluation shows it is natural for the teachers and the students with a flexible and effective interactive teaching pattern. Therefore, such system brings a new programming teaching patterns and help students to stride the obstacle between the flowchart and the programming language. Students can learn the abstract programming idea and the concrete coding skills effectively and efficiently by the visual comparative learning assisted by the intelligent whiteboard system. &copy; 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

  Abstract                 = {Software flaws are a root cause of many of today's information security vulnerabilities. Current curricula emphasis on traditional information security issues does not address this root cause. We propose educating students on secure programming techniques through interactive tool support in the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). We believe this approach can complement other curricula efforts by teaching and providing continuous reinforcement of practices throughout programming tasks. In this paper, we evaluate our prototype tool, ASIDE, which provides instant security warnings, detailed explanations of vulnerabilities, and code generation. We report the results of an observational study on 20 students from an advanced Web programming course. The results provide early evidence that our tool could potentially help students learn about and practice secure programming in the context of their programming assignments.
